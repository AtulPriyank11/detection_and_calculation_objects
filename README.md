# Object Detection and Surface Area Calculation using Detectron2 and OpenCV

This Python script utilizes Detectron2, a powerful library for object detection, to identify and measure the surface area of objects in images. It employs Mask R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) for accurate instance segmentation and calculates the area based on known pixel-to-centimeter ratios.
